#To Do List

We had several small parts of the game site working in isolation. These parts included the home page, the page for setting up the teams, initializing the cards and the game board. After integrating the pieces they didn't work together well.

Further high-level tasks remaining:

* Converge on site structure and parameter passing. We used differing approaches for the individual pages, e.g. get/post HTTP methods, posted values vs URL segments for paratemer passing.
* Build game logic to conduct the game following initialization
* Implement checks for edge cases to make game more robust.
